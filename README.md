# System-information
Checking system information using python module platform.

Finding your system information using a python module.

The requirements to use the module is nothing, it's available to most of us as it's a inuilt module and incase if u cant find it below is the code to install it in pip.

        pip install platform
    
Output:
    
        System: Windows
        node: LAPTOP-N9O96HRM
        platform: Windows-10-10.0.19043-SP0
        processor: AMD64 Family 23 Model 96 Stepping 1, AuthenticAMD
        Python version: 3.9.7
        Python implementation: CPython

* here the node is equivalent to the value of host in my previous repo regarding socket, which 
you can find link by [licking here](https://github.com/BhargavKadali39/ip_address_finder)
* The python implementation is basically saying Cpython which mea.ns, originally python was interpreted through CProgramming 
to make it faster so behind the screen there is some c programming going on whi h we don't see and this is a well known fact about python.

* I actually have python 3.9.7 and 3.10 both installed so I'm having some difficulties processing them together.
These are some problems faced by me and others hope you can help me it would be so jice of you.
